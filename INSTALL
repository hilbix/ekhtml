BUILDING:

    Requirements:

        APR - The Apache Portable Runtime library.
              You can currently only obtain this in source format from
              apache.org.  

              $ CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic
              $ export CVSROOT
              $ cvs login
                (password is "anoncvs")
              $ cvs co apr

              Read 'apr/README.dev' for information on how to build the
              library.


    To build EL-Kabong from a tarball, run:

              $ ./configure --with-apr=/path/to/apr && make

    To build EL-Kabong from CVS, run:

              $ ./autogen.sh --with-apr=/path/to/apr && make

   

GETTING STARTED (using the library):

    The best way to get started would be to browse testsuite/tester.c
    This is the file that El-Kabong uses to run its tests.

    API documentation can be found in docs/html/index.html
