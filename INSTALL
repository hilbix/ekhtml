BUILDING:

    To build EL-Kabong from a tarball, run:

              $ ./configure && make

    To build EL-Kabong from CVS, run:

              $ ./autogen.sh && make

   

GETTING STARTED (using the library):

    The best way to get started would be to browse testsuite/tester.c
    This is the file that El-Kabong uses to run its tests.

    API documentation can be found in docs/html/index.html
