	*  Released into Open Source by Covalent Technologies.

	*  Remove unneeded pool allocation and destruction from endtag
	code.  Also cleaned up some of the code in special tag processing.

	*  Further optimized character map lookups.  Instead of 5 tables
	storing binary values, we store them all in 1 table, and logical
	AND them with masks to look for the appropriate characters.  
	The speedup is small but shows up in benchmarks.

	*  Made a few optimizations.  Shaves about 16% off my test cases.
	YMMV.

	*  Fixed bug with incorrect callback data being sent to the parser
	callback functions.  Also added a test for the condition.

	*  Revamped pretty much everything.  A redesign in the archetecture
	allowed us to do some keen stuff:  added the ability comment callbacks,
	fixed boolean attribute parsing, forgive more brizz0k3n HTML.  This
	should also be a fairly speedy implementation.

	* Initial version released.  This version still has some
	issues with poorly written HTML (i.e. <FOO<BAR>hello</BAR></FOO>)
	which it could handle better.  In addition, attributes with no
	direct value aren't supported yet.  I.e <FOO BAR>  And finally,
	I'd like to maintain state inbetween tag calls, to speed it up
	quite a bit.
